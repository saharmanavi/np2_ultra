Widefield Analysis
==============================

Package for analyzing 2-photon imaging and behavior data. Readme info mostly copied from Justin Kiggins


## Installation

This package is designed to be installed using standard Python packaging tools. For example,

    python setup.py install

If you are using pip to manage packages and versions (recommended), you can also install using pip:

    pip install ./

If you are plan to contribute to the development of the package, I recommend installing in "editable" mode:

    pip install -e ./

This ensures that Python uses the current, active files in the folder (even while switching between branches).

## API

Here's a quick overview of each of the files:
